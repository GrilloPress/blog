Explaining what something it is almost always better than using a technical term for it.

Don’t use complicated, specialist language in a service.

Even audiences you think will know what a word means will benefit from explaining a thing.

Avoid complex phrases unless you have clear and unambiguous proof.

Designing in the world of data, privacy and medical records you often have complicated concepts. And equally complicated terms:

- Anonymisation
- Pseudonymisation
- Data minimisation

In user research we see the negative reaction to these terms. Users find them confusing. Or evasive. And they are.

Instead of saying anonymisation, talk about information that has personal details removed. And give examples.

> When we share your information with another organisation, we remove all personal details such as your name and address

Being open and clear isn’t without problems. Exposing how you use someone else’s data can be problematic. But it’s the truth. And you shouldn’t be processing data without good reason.

Technical terms or metaphors are always the worst choice.

Explain the thing. Your service or product will benefit from it.
