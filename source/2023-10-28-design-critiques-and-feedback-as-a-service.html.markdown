Whilst I was writing up [Why designers design forms](./2023-10-27-why-we-design-forms.html) I started thinking about the times I've worked in large organisations to convince people about design. The time I've spent making it easier for teams to learn about design. And the process of it and how to use designers to make things better.

If you're in any sort of government or enterprise organisation there's a good chance there are some designers. Some "UX" types somewhere. And some enthusiasts.

One of the most convincing and impactful things I found was showing (and not telling) the value of design.

That is, not going around and doing a presentation about a particular design practice and telling people to respect it. But making it and the value it brings to life for people by doing it.

Saving the face of a director in a pinch. Making something better. Making things more efficient in a crisis. I've used lots of those moments to [win the space to do design](./2021/03/19/win-space-to-design.html).

But what about teams and services that don't have much budget? Or still don't believe a thing you're selling?

## Building faith in design with a community approach

In many enterprise or government departments you don't always get to put designers and people in the spots that most need design. But you typically get to create powerful communities of practice and sharing. Often because it's damn hard to make change happen.

When I worked in a local hospital. There was no UX team. Only people who cared about doing things right. Or making interfaces. A blend of UX, UI and frontend people. As well as patient advocates and quality improvement people.

<h2 class="h3">Finding a way to work with a designer</h2>

. There's a good chance there are some designers around. Find them. From paying for 1 to working out a support arrangement or some "crits". Find a way to get input.

When I was leading design in UKHSA, I helped UKHSA connect their content crit community with teams that were building systems and forms without designers so there was a minimum level of support. We were able to improve how labs collected test data. And build experience and confidence in that team in how to work with designers and how to get 1 to join.

If you are a designer. Be conscious of this. Have you created a way for teams to begin their journey to getting support and learn the value of collaborating with a designer?
