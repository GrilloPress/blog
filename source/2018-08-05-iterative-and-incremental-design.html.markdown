Part of the summer the design and research team for the National Data Opt-out has been looking at how we can make it easier for users to authenticate themselves.

As we explored problems unique to being in public beta. As well as possible solutions. A few grumbles were raised about the speed to have an answer to an issue.

We had some things which we put a solution into the service fast. And others we took a little more time to explore.

Some of the issue raised was our fault for being so fast. We build and test things fast. So we had built up a reputation and a level of response unheard of in most teams.

But the real crux of the issue was a misunderstanding of the difference between incremental and iterative design.
