Before going on leave I got to work with a graduate designer (Sam) who will be joining me on a couple of projects. Over three days we covered interaction flows, content architecture and paper forms.

With Sam joining me, it made me think about design process. Creating a good one. A repeatable, efficient process that creates great outcomes.

Whilst working on the National Data Opt-out we (myself and a junior designer Dan) crafted a process that helped us explore a massive range of ideas and issues.

The process didnâ€™t appear fully-formed. It took many iterations. It evolved through experience and being worked.

[I blogged about the journey](https://grillopress.github.io/2018/01/08/kanban_for_interaction_design.html), centring on our use of a kanban board.

The key to creating a great design process is to treat it like a design problem.

That is,

- Start by stating the issue you want to solve
- Sketch out crude flows and processes
- Create a prototype and use it in anger
- Iterate over things again and again
- Seek feedback from those around you
- Articulate and defend your ideas to expose flaws and strengths

The kanban board felt the best mechanism to control and test the process.  

With new work and a new team, it's a great time to explore our process again.
