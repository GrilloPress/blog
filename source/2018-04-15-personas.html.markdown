Recently at work and on Twitter I asked if people were currently using personas.

Do you?

The results came out only just marginally in persona's favour. Part of the reason for this is purposefully using the word **currently** in the question.

Personas being a tool and there being lots of different ways of doing design well, leads to situations where personas may not be the right tool for the job.

Some people **always** use personas. Some almost never.

As we discussed personas, many examples of the good things about personas came out. As well as concerns.

## There are many different types of personas

Use cases included:

- co-design tools
- research outputs
- communication tools
- design modelling
- presumption unearthing
- customer modelling
- empathy creation

## The right tool for your process

The key to using personas well is therefore having a strong, purposeful design process. If you know what you want to achieve (generate ideas, test an idea, explore what problems we have, ensure everyone is on the same page) then there is a persona archetype for you.

Personas are like the Swiss-army knife of design tools.
