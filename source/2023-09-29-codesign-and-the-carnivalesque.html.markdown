Codesign is popular thing right now. I've heard it from lots of different corners of programme, project and delivery management. Nevermind research and design worlds.

I like codesign. It's about involving the people who are impacted by your design in the process of design. Of opening up and evening out power to create. But it's something that gets said a lot.

The promise of codesign is great. But the reality of how it's done is often not so.

In this way, it's a lot like the carnivalesque and moments of the carnival.

The carnivalesque is a literary and cultural concept that refers to a temporary mode of subversion and rebellion against social norms and conventions. It originated from the medieval carnival, which was a time when people would gather and engage in festivities, often involving role reversals, masks, and other forms of transgression. The carnivalesque is a moment in time where roles are reversed that this is allowed to challenge and undermine established hierarchies and power structures by inverting or parodying them.

In the carnivalesque, the boundaries between high and low, sacred and profane, and normal and abnormal are blurred or even reversed. This leads to a sense of liberation and freedom, as individuals are encouraged to express themselves and act outside of their usual roles.

The process of codesign and cocreation can be similar to the carnivalesque in several ways. Firstly, both involve a sense of playfulness and experimentation, where individuals are encouraged to explore different ideas and possibilities in a non-conventional way. Like the carnivalesque, codesign and cocreation allow for the breaking down of barriers and the crossing of boundaries between different disciplines, perspectives, and ways of thinking.

Secondly, both codesign and cocreation are collaborative processes that involve a collective effort to create something new and innovative. This collaboration often leads to a disruption of traditional power structures, where participants are given an equal voice and agency in the design process. This reflects the carnivalesque's inversion of power hierarchies and its emphasis on collective participation and democratic decision-making.

True carnivalesque is about unmanaged, unrefined sense of upheaval and fun bubbling under the surface that at any moment can strike hard at false certainties. Striking at strict hierarchy where there are things that are always true. And “that’s how it works”. The carnivalesque is about upending roles. The lords become the peasants and those without power become the lords.

Lots of design tools and techniques attempt to use this. None more so than codesign.

And this is where codesign is the most powerful. Where it recreates this feeling. Where in a room, in a community those typically excluded from decision making, making and producing have the power. The influence. And the reward.

However. As with anything where there’s a transfer of power from those that have it. It’s scary. People will ask for “unrealistic things”. A strength. But also a threat. And with any threatening things, a risk to erradicate or minimise.

So, codesign doesn’t happen.

Or if it does. It doesn’t actually influence or change anything beyond the moment of fun. Relegated to an hour of hope, exchanged in the long term for pessimism and sense that was a bloody waste of time

And if that feels dramatic. I’ve seen it plenty. With people faithfully wanting to create the conditions to use what comes out of the chaos of codesign. But those in power having no acceptance or readiness to share power or take the fruits of codesign forward. Teams, communities and organizations then learn (rightfully) to distrust those with power. To roll their eyes. To say “we’ve heard this before”. And then they shun the next show. Turning down any tickets to the show. 

And who’d blame them?

Next time you're encouraging your users and communities to get involved. And take a codesign approach. Ask yourself: does your codesign project promise the carnival but leave your participants feeling like clowns?
