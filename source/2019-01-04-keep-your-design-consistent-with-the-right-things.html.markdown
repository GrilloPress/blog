Keeping things consistent is a common design principle or rule.

If you make interactions work in a consistent way, your users will be better able to use your system. Particularly if they have to use it regularly or for a long time.

Being consistent doesn't mean uniform however. Uniformity is a level of visual and interaction sameness that doesn't change regardless of context.

Whereas uniformity in design means a system that is always the same, consistency is about something being applied generally.

Across all your pages, your links are broadly similar. And only deviate based on particular reasons, such as usability, contrast etc.

[consistency in design is the wrong approach](https://articles.uie.com/consistency-in-design-is-the-wrong-approach/)

Unlike Jared I'm unsure if designers are very good at making things consistent. Locally or globally.

Is the goal of consistent design a user-centred activity or a system-centred activity?
