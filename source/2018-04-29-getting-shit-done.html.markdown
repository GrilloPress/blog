Making UX agile

I was recently talking to a product owner on a different team about how they worked. How they took their user research and made it actionable.

As we were talking she mentioned one of the principles the squads had. The team had three products but a set of principles. One of them was "get shit done".

You've all probably heard or had a similar principle. Deliver. Build things.

We have all worked on projects that could do with a bit more of this.

But what also struck me hearing this phrase, is that it can be the antithesis of delivering the right thing.

Getting shit done without care is "shitting the bed".

No one is putting that on a t-shirt.

I had no worries about the product owner I was talking to. They seemed to have a great understanding of user research. But it's a real tension.

There will always be a tension between design and delivery
And that is okay. Design tries to get things right. And delivery is about making a thing real. There is always a need to balance making the right thing and making something real.

Youâ€™ll never know for sure if something works until it is used by real people. So get something out in front of a user.

Being agile as a designer, or doing agile design, is about finding that path.
