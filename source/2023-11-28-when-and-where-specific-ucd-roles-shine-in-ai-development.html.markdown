## The when, where and what part UCD roles play in an AI development process

If we take a simplified process for developing an AI platform or product as 4 iterative steps we can layer in when and what types of UCD skills are most important.

The stages are:

1. __Create vision of AI / product / next release__
2. __Explore data and tech feasibility__
3. __Create a prototype model or product__
4. __Learn and reflect on how product and tech met needs__

This loop can be lengthy. Or can be tight. A skilled team could do things in days or weeks. I've done this loop in a single workshop. Or you can take months. Whether you understand your business goals and user's needs is the important part and will tell you what pace to run.

The loop is cyclical. But when you learn things aren't feasible you can skip prototying things and the reflection can quickly change a vision of what's possible. For example, a lot of organisations are finding data engineering challenges in (2.) mean they have to change their vision of how things work for now.

The broad phases can be uneven too. You'll find many places spend a lot of time in (2.) without learning from making or with their users.

The model is not necessarily user centred. And I’d say a large majority of building on top of AI isn’t right now. But the immense creativity of people and power of AI has made products far more useful and fun than even the teams making AI products could have predicted.

But this iterative process can excel in being user centred. You just need teams to stop thinking that big brains can think their way through everything.

So, a model like this helps us understand where our teams spend their time. And what sort of roles are well suited to each part of process. Good user centred design can play a part on making this great. For example:

### Creating a vision (1) and feasibility (2) 

In these 2 phases the skills and roles that make the most impact are those who deeply understand how things work today and customers and user behaviour. And those who can help facilitate multiple people to work together to map out their assumptions and ideas collaboratively and visually.

User researchers, service designers and UX/Interaction designers able to look wider than just the UI steps can make a real impact here. Helping explore with build, data and business teams the art of possible. Using facilitation and visualisation techniques to show how something works today and what to change. Or to get down in a single vision of how we think things should work.

The key here is bring people who understand users and people with those who understand and can create tech and data. And using both skillsets to complement and bounce off each other in unique and novel ways.

On a project last year I worked on. There was a data scientist who was jumping deep into an idea and how it could work in a different way. The clinical product owner wasn't able to answer a question about process directly. The data scientist had a vision how it could work. However I was able to bring in some research and visualise how our users managed clinical cases. The vision from the engineer was smart. But it wouldn't have worked for the way people managed cases and that it wasn't a behaviour change that would have been easy to embed. Which was confirmed by the clinical product owner as they reflected on the process I explained. The engineer had a good vision but didn't work for there. Rather than waste some time finding out things after building some prototypes we used existing knowledge to do something else. To optimise another thing which ultimately helped get better data into our systems and reduce the time it took people to manage cases.

Understanding people also helps to understand the risk of our approaches and the potential harm it can create. And UCD teams are well placed in ensuring we codesign and involve our users in the process where possible. Particularly when we're thinking long term.

The tech and product feasibility phase is particularly where designers who understand tech and can sit with data and engineering teams to understand and explore the implications of what we can do today really shine. They're able to create stories and visualisations of how things could work. Which further pushes and explores what needs to be possible for a vision to work.

On an non-AI data project I remember talking to 2 software engineers about their idea for creating a base data engineering template. They walked me through their design and thinking. As I collected the steps and processes they expected the data engineers to follow they realised some of the steps were technically easier for them. But weren't going to be something a data engineer would particularly find easy to do. This was also a process a data engineer would have to set up or manage a data pipeline.

They had some "expert users" who had reviewed the work earlier but they didn't quite get the engagement they expected. Mostly because the implication of new tech was hard to understand. They couldn't imagine what it really meant. We were able to quickly rethink the approach and later that sprint we had a much more intuitive approach for the data engineers. When we showed it to them we got much better feedback because the data engineers could understand the thing better.

As you find some flaws and things to resolve to make your product or platforms work. UCD teams are also well placed to design or patch up things. From better forms, content or whole processes.

### Creating prototypes / new features (3) and reflecting on if things meet needs (4)

Once you've set a vision of what your model, platform, product or AI assisted feature is going to do and that it looks feasible you need to start prototyping and making it real. Either by making it or building on top of proof of concepts. Or by tuning and optimising things so that the underlying product or model makes possible what you want it to.

This phase builds on the skills of designers to create realistic end to end prototypes and journeys. Helping create a compelling full experience so that you don't just get feedback on small details but how it'd really work.

Content designers help tweak, iterate and improve the language and way our systems are structured and talk and interact with our users. Making things clearer and easier to use.

User researchers will help you set up the right processes to get users and customers and get quick and realistic feedback from users, stakeholders and customers.

They'll also help you get into the WHY alongside any data you create.

I worked with a team that anticipated really high use of a feature. But after they updated the model and their custom instructions they had loads of customers complain about it and stop using it. Research with their users helped triangulate and identify what people were doing with the product and the reasons that a seemingly beneficial feature had made things worse for people. It was a classic case of listening to people speculate about what was important rather than what they really did.

As you move into phases where you reflect on what you’ve learnt you’ll need people who can analyse user behaviour and explain why things are happening. People who are good at telling stories and visualising what's happening and not happening. And helping teams have honest conversations about what will need to change to meet our original vision.

These are the skills your designers and researchers should have.

As your customers and users use things. You'll get lots of feedback about features and missing things. There are virtual graveyards of start-ups and teams who blindly just implement things based on feedback from users and stakeholders. User researchers particularly are your dispassionate voice for what people NEED. As opposed to what they just said.

## It's a team sport. How we pull together to win

The skills that are useful in making AI user-centred and ultimately successful are:

- Understanding the as-is
- Explaining what problems and issues we and our users have today
- Helping people see the "why" behind those issues 
- Understanding the tasks, journeys and words that people use
- Exploring what impact change will have
- Defining the impact our models and data will have on our users and people in our wider community
- Understanding the challenges and risks our vision or product will create. And doing so with the communities impacted
- Helping facilitate and visualise ideas, journeys and opinions
- Gently and constructively challenging group think
- Bringing together disparate voices and users to make the best service or product
- Prototyping and making real end to end services or products
- Getting our products and designs in front of users and customers
- Analysing and bringing out key themes of success and issues with what we've built
- Helping people see what our users and customers need from us instead of just what they've asked

These are things good designers and researchers provide.

If we bring these skills together with data, engineering and business skills in an iterative process we'll be successful with AI. If we don't we and our organisations won't stand apart from other products, tools and approaches.

This is the role UCD should play and to make a real impact.
