In the design world you often hear talk of work being "iterative".

Iterative design is the act of repeating a process with the aim of creating a desired outcome.

A design iteration then, is the output of your design process done once.

A well-known design process is the "design sprint". A time-boxed, five day blueprint.

In the computer science world recursion is like essentially an iteration without prior knowledge of how many times you need to do a thing.

```
// Iterative

Do this 10 times
  Eat

// Recursive

Until full
  Eat

```
