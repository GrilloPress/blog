A core component of a good team, and accountability, is being set up for success. For yourself. And those around you.

Being set up for success is about having a clear sense of the outcomes you want. And the capability to deliver them.

You can measure this with some questions:

- Am I clear what I am looking to achieve?
- Are others around me clear what I am trying to do?
- Do I have the skills to achieve what I need to do?
- If I do not have the skills, do I have a plan to develop them? Or access to resources that mean this doesn’t matter?
- Do I know when I am done? When I achieved what I want?
- Would other people agree with that measurement?

Good answers to these questions will involve good communication between you and others. And knowing how things get “done” (If that is vague where you work. It’s worth mapping it out).

You’ll also have to be honest about your limits. Something I have always struggled with (who doesn’t want to be the person who can do it all?).

It’s hard work.

But being clear on the why and how something’s going to get done is how you create accountability. And with a clear way we can measure success, everyone is able to help judge and support each other to succeed.

Make it clear what outcomes you’re trying to achieve. And how you’re going to do that.
